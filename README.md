# python_face_recognition_BASIC
mind this code, normally only works on Linux, so, before executing,  there are few requisites:

- install wheel ( pip instal wheel) in Linux terminal
- install face_recognition ( pip install face_recognition) in Linux terminal

# PERFECT
know u are good to go and execute it. Note u can give into input while executing, a folder path (with some images with faces to recognize) or just the path to 1 singular photo with at least 1 human face. it will store (on RAM, in a variable) a matrix with the values acording to each face, but u can store it on any file (like a csv or txt, whatever).

i haven't tried to execute it from a no-regular Linux distribution, like Linux Mint, BSD, Termux or others. But it works fine on Windows Subsystem Linux (search WSL on Windows Characteristics and turn it on, then restart your PC when installation finishes and requires it).
